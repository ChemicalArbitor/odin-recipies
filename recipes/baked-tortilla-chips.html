                <h3>Description</h3> 
                    <p>Tasty tortilla chips baked at home with corn tortillas are much better than store-bought chips. With an amazing lime and cumin flavor, these crispy, golden chips taste great with your favorite salsa, guacamole, or hummus.</p>
                <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 package corn tortillas</li>
                        <li>3 tablespoons lime juice</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon beef tallow</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p></li>
                        <li><p>Stack tortillas in layers of 5 or 6. Cut through each stack to make 8 wedges. Arrange wedges in a single layer on rimmed baking sheets.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Combine lime juice and oil in a spray bottle or mister; shake until well mixed. Spray the tops of the tortilla wedges until slightly moist.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Combine cumin, chili powder, and salt in a small bowl; sprinkle mixture over the chips.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven for 7 minutes.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Remove from the oven. Flip chips, then mist and season again.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Return to the oven, rotating the pans and switching racks. Bake, checking often to ensure they don't burn, until chips are lightly browned and crisp, 5 to 8 more minutes.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Remove from the oven and cool slightly before serving. Chips will crisp up more as they cool.</p></li>
                    </ol>
